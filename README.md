# Project-penguin
This project analyzes the Palmer Penguins dataset, focusing on body size measurements of Ad√©lie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins. The analysis uncovers differences in measurements across species and sexes, explores correlations, and highlights statistical paradoxes like Simpson's Paradox. Visualizations provide insights into these fascinating birds.
