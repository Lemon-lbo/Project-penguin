# Project Penguin : EDA & Visualization

This project analyzes the **Palmer Penguins** dataset, focusing on body size measurements of *Adélie*, *Gentoo*, and *Chinstrap* penguins. The analysis is performed in **R**, with emphasis on aesthetic data visualization and exploratory analysis *to support understanding of the biological and statistical insights within the dataset*.

## Highlights

- Examines species-wise and sex-wise differences in physical features
- Investigates correlations between bill length, flipper length, and body mass
- Visualizes patterns using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots
- Demonstrates statistical phenomena like **Simpson’s Paradox**

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle – Palmer Archipelago Penguin Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data?resource=download)
- Originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman.

## Tools & Technologies
