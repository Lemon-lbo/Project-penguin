# Project-penguin
This project analyzes the Palmer Penguins dataset, focusing on body size measurements of Ad√©lie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins. The analysis uncovers differences in measurements across species and sexes, explores correlations, and highlights statistical paradoxes like Simpson's Paradox. Visualizations provide insights into these fascinating birds. Data has been collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data?resource=download).
